## About Nox Engine TEST

Nox Engine is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline the game development process. It moves away from rigid code architectures to offer a modular, extensible workflow. With **Real-Time Rendering**, every light, mesh, and physics parameter updates instantly as you adjust sliders, ensuring lightning-fast iteration cycles.

## Key Features

### Workflow & Logic
* **Behaviours:** Component scripts for real-time logic, integrated directly into the render loop.
* **Actions:** Smart triggers that allow event chaining without writing extra lines of code.
* **Native Nodes:** Visualize the scene hierarchy like a living organism. Drag, drop, and configure ease.

### Graphics & Visuals
* **Real-Time Rendering:** Instant visual feedback for all scene changes.
* **Visual Shader Editor:** Create complex materials by importing custom shader files or using included presets. Fully integrated with the PBR lighting pipeline.
* **Animation Suite:** Keyframe animations, blending, and timeline control for cinematic quality results.

## Ecosystem

Nox Engine is designed to take projects from prototype to final product efficiently using a production-ready library.

* **Smart Prefabs:** Drag-and-drop production-ready components, including characters, particle systems, and cameras.
* **Asset Hub:** A collection of 3D models and textures optimized specifically for the engine.
